# Dynamical model inference with single-cell flow data using a conditional VAE

In this project, we will combine dynamic modeling with single-cell type data.
We make use of the Pyro framework, which is built on top of Pytorch and makes variational inference (relatively) easy. 
As a basic introduction to Pyro, we've included a *Pyro 101* tutorial notebook.

## Notebooks

- `pyro-101.ipynb`: a very quick intro to Pyro and variational inference.
- `fit-dyn-model.ipynb`: fitting a dynamical model to single-cell data using Pyro.
